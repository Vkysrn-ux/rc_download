# RC Template Images

Place your official blank RC template images here:

- `public/rc-template/front.jpg`
- `public/rc-template/back.jpg`

Or, if you only have a single combined image that contains both sides (front on the left, back on the right), you can use:

- `public/rc-template/template.jpg`

The app renders these images as the exact background for downloads (PNG/PDF), then overlays the RC fields on top.
